<span class="smcap">Mustapha</span> his Son.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>S the Town has been so agreeably
entertain’d with the Tragedy of
Mustapha, written by the celebrated
Author of <span class="smcap">Eurydice</span>, and
other valuable Pieces, I think it will not be
amiss to give a short Account of the Life
and Actions of <i>Solyman</i>, the Father of <i>Mustapha</i>,
mix’d with those of that unfortunate Prince,
who gives Title to the Play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">(2)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> the Magnificent, (Father to
<i>Mustapha</i>, by a beautiful <i>Circassian</i> Slave,
and <i>Tzianger</i>, by the ambitious <i>Roxolana</i>)
was one of the most potent Princes of the
<i>Othoman Race</i>: He was the Son of <i>Selimus</i>,
who died in the midst of his Victories,
upon the Road to Adrianople, of a <i>Cancer</i>
in his Reins, in September 1520, when
<i>Charles</i> V. was Emperor of <i>Germany</i>, <i>Henry</i>
VIII. King of <i>England</i>, <i>Francis</i> I. King
of France, <i>James</i> V. King of <i>Scotland</i>,
and <i>Leo</i> X. Pope of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the Time of his Father’s Death,
<i>Solyman</i> was at <i>Magnesia</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">(A)</a>, and receiving
Notice of his Father’s Death from <i>Ferhates
Bassa</i>, only, (as <i>Selimus</i> his Father had formerly
attempted to poison him, fearing his
amiable Qualities) gave little Credit to the
Information: But when he received the
Confirmation from <i>Pyrrhus</i>, and <i>Mustapha</i>,
<i>Bassas</i> at Adrianople, he ventur’d to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">(3)</a></span>Scutari<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">(B)</a>, where he was met by the <i>Aga</i> of
the <i>Janizaries</i><a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">(C)</a>, and Numbers of the
People, (yet ignorant of the Death of <i>Selimus</i>)
from whence he was conducted over
to <i>Constantinople</i><a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">(D)</a>, where the Body of the
<i>Janizaries</i> were prepar’d on the Shore to
meet him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Moment he landed, the <i>Aga</i> cry’d
with a loud Voice, <i>Behold</i> your <i>Emperor</i>
<span class="smcap">Solyman</span>! The <i>Janizaries</i>, transported
with Joy, reply’d with one Voice, Long live
<span class="smcap">Solyman</span>, our great Emperor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> was in his Twentieth Year,
when he was first seated in the Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">(4)</a></span><i>Throne</i>; and for several Years reign’d as a
<i>benign Prince</i>. But being corrupted by the
Artifices of <i>Roxolana</i>, and the impious Designs
of <i>Rustan</i> his Grand Vizir, who wedded
a Daughter of <i>Roxolana</i>’s, began to dip
his Hands in Blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span> he perform’d many glorious
Actions at the Head of his own Armies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first Year of his Reign, he took
from <i>Lewis</i> King of <i>Hungary</i>, a peaceable
Prince, the strong City of <i>Belgrade</i><a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">(E)</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">(5)</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> afterwards turn’d his Arms against
the City of <i>Rhodes</i>. I shall be something
particular in this Siege, because our Countrymen
had a hand in bravely defending the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> was not present at the first
investing of<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">(F)</a> <i>Rhodes</i>; but his Troops being
often beat by the Besieged, and losing
above forty Thousand of his Soldiers, (tho’
the <i>Rhodians</i> were not six Thousand fighting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">(6)</a></span>Men) be repair’d to the Camp to encourage his Troops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor’s Arrival gave new life
to his fainting Army; and perceiving the
<i>English</i> Bulwark annoy’d him most, sprung
a Mine, that blew many a brave <i>Englishman</i>
to Immortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Turks upon this Success, with loud
Shouts attack’d the Breach; but the Grand
Master, <i>Philip Vellinus</i>, at the Head of the
remaining <i>English</i>, repuls’d them, with the
Loss of two Thousand <i>Janizaries</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cannon of the Besieged did great
Execution among the <i>Turks</i>, and their being
often repuls’d, gave <i>Solyman</i> but little
Hopes of gaining the City by Force; for
even the Women of all Degrees threw down
Stones from the Battlements on the Heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">(7)</a></span>of the Besiegers, when they came to scale
their Walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span>, after musing alone in his
Tent, sent for all his chief Commanders,
and told them he would make one general
Assault; and if the City was taken, the
Troops should be rewarded with the Plunder.</p>

<p>A poor Christian Slave hearing the Proclamation
to the Troops, found Means to
let the <i>Rhodians</i> know of <i>Solyman</i>’s Design
for the next Day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Grand Master</i> (at this Notice) prepar’d
every thing to oppose them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next Morning before Break of Day,
the <i>Turks</i> attack’d the City with loud <i>Tecbirs</i>,
or Shouts of <i>Onset</i>, in five several
Places at once with fifty Thousand Men.
The Enemy was repuls’d with great Slaughter
from the <i>English</i> and <i>Italian</i> Quarter. But
in the mean time <i>Mustapha</i> Bassa, and <i>Achmetes</i>
Bassa, attack’d the <i>Spanish</i> Bulwark,
(whose Defenders were three parts gone to
assist the <i>Italian</i> and <i>English</i>) and soon became
Masters of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the <i>Grand Master</i>, with several
Knights of the Order, retook it again, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">(8)</a></span>
an obstinate Defence, with the Death of all
the <i>Turks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Success gave new Life to the <i>Rhodians</i>,
who every where repuls’d their Enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> on a neighbouring Hill saw
all with the utmost Vexation of Mind, and
seeing no Hope of Success, order’d a Retreat
to be sounded: The harrass’d Troops
retir’d to their Camp, leaving above twenty
Thousand of their Fellows lifeless behind
them, as a Token of the Valour of their
Enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> ill Success so provok’d <i>Solyman</i>, that
he gave Orders that <i>Mustapha Bassa</i> should
immediately be put to death, tho’ he had
done all in the Assault a wise and brave General
could do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrrhus</span> <i>Bassa</i> hearing of this severe
Command, notwithstanding <i>Solyman</i>’s Rage,
went to intercede for him; but his Rage
continuing, he order’d <i>Pyrrhus</i> to undergo
the same Fate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rest of his Council fell at his Feet
to hinder so cruel a Command, some begging
to suffer with them, vowing never to
rise till their honest Suit was granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">(9)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor’s Passion at last subsiding,
he pardon’d <i>Mustapha</i> and <i>Pyrrhus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span>, his Admiral, because he could
not prevent the Relief that came by Sea into
the Town, did not fare quite so well. He
was order’d to receive the Bastinado (or
Scourging) as a common Slave, on board
his own Galley, and had been put to death,
but for the Persuasion of <i>Achmetes Bassa</i>,
who had a great Influence over <i>Solyman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Emperor’s</i> ill Success began to make
him turn his Thoughts from the Siege, tho’
with the utmost Reluctance; to see the Course
of his victorious Arms stopp’d by a handful
of Men, was what his ambitious Soul could
not bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> summon’d another Council of War
of all his grand Officers, where, after many
Debates, he was persuaded to continue the
Siege, and by the Strength of their Vows
and Promises to conquer, he began to build
him a Palace on the Brow of Mount <i>Philermus</i>,
where from the Battlements he
could take a View of what was done in the
City of <i>Rhodes</i>. But the Gross of the <i>Turkish</i>
Army murmur’d at the Continuance
of the Siege, shot Letters upon the Heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">(10)</a></span>
of Arrows frequently into the Town discovering
every thing that was done in
Council, with Promise of the Revolt of
<i>Mustapha Bassa</i> for the ill Usage he had receiv’d
from the Emperor <i>Solyman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> notwithstanding the Valour of the
<i>Rhodians</i>, (who twice more repuls’d the <i>Othomans</i>
with great Slaughter) they began to
want every thing that was necessary: And
by eager Persuasions of the Inhabitants that
had Families in the City, he was prevail’d
upon to send an Embassy to <i>Solyman</i>, tho’
not before the <i>Turks</i> had gain’d two hundred
Paces in Breadth, and a hundred and fifty
in Length, within the outward Wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the <i>Ambassador</i> came before <i>Solyman</i>,
he demanded the immediate Surrender
of the City; and if the <i>Rhodians</i> would
trust his Clemency, now, without farther
Hostilities, their Lives, Estates and Freedoms
should be safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> imagining these Promises
would prevail upon the harrass’d <i>Rhodians</i>,
sent a Letter to the same purpose to be read
in publick to them by a <i>Genoese</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Letter was read, the Grand
Master was of the opinion to hold out the
Siege to the last: But a <i>Greek Priest</i>, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">(11)</a></span>
Tears running down his Cheeks, begg’d
he would prevent the final Destruction of so
many innocent People; at the same time
praising the Clemency of <i>Solyman</i> to those
that yielded to his Arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was constrain’d to comply with their
Desires, and surrender’d the City to the
Emperor, who enter’d in Triumph on the
25th of <i>December</i> 1522.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Year 1526, <i>Solyman</i> turn’d his
Arms against <i>Hungary</i>, with an Army of
two hundred thousand Men, and advanc’d
as far as <i>Sophia</i><a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">(G)</a>, before the indolent <i>Lewis</i>
King of <i>Hungary</i> heard of his March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> <i>Mohatz</i><a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">(H)</a> the young King met <i>Solyman</i>’s
Army with twenty-five thousand
Men, and by ill Persuasion gave Battle on the
29th of <i>October</i> 1528, and his Army was
defeated. <i>Lewis</i> endeavouring to make his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">(12)</a></span>Escape, was smother’d in a Ditch where his
Horse had plung’d him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> did nothing extraordinary in
the military Way till the Spring 1529, When
the Fame of his Arms made the strong City
<i>Buda</i><a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">(I)</a> an easy Conquest; for the Inhabitants,
struck with in universal Terror, abandon’d
the Place, and he enter’d the empty
<i>City</i> in <i>Triumph</i>. But the <i>Citadel</i> Was bravely
defended by the Governor, <i>Thomas Nadasti</i>,
till the Garrison was reduc’d to three hundred;
who seiz’d the Governor, to deliver
him up to <i>Solyman</i>, upon Condition they
were to march out with Bag and Baggage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">(13)</a></span>But <i>Solyman</i> despising their Trachery, order’d
his <i>Janizaries</i> to put the Soldiers to
Death, and dismiss’d the <i>Governor</i> with
magnificent Presents, for the Revard of his
Valour, and Integrity to his Prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the taking of <i>Buda</i>, <i>Solyman</i> was
resolv’d to penetrate into the Heart of <i>Germany</i>,
and lay siege to the City of<a name="FNanchor_K_10" id="FNanchor_K_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_10" class="fnanchor">(K)</a> <i>Vienna</i>,
the capital City of <i>Austria</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his March he suffer’d his Troops to
commit all Sorts of Outrages, destroying all
the Country with Fire and Sword, even beyond
<i>Vienna</i>, as far as <i>Lintz</i><a name="FNanchor_L_11" id="FNanchor_L_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_11" class="fnanchor">(L)</a>. He encamp’d
before the City, <i>September</i> the 26th,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">(14)</a></span>1529, and invested it, that no Succour could
be sent into the Town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> sent word by several Prisoners he had
taken, that it was in vain to defend their
<i>Walls</i> against the vindictive Force that had
conquer’d <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>Belgrade</i> and <i>Buda</i>. But
receiving no Answer, but <i>Sallies</i> from the
city, he began to plant his <i>Cannon</i>, and
batter the <i>Walls</i>, tho’ without Success; for
his heavy Cannon, with the Vessels that bore
them, were sunk in the <i>Danube</i> by the brave
<i>Wolfgang Hoder</i>, Commander of the Grand
Duke’s Galleys. This unexpected Misfortune
gave <i>Solyman</i>, not only Uneasiness, but
Terror, which was augmented by Reports,
that all the Powers of <i>Germany</i> were marching
to protect <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> every Assault he seem’d to have the
worst; all his <i>Mines</i> were <i>countermined</i>, and
blown up, with considerable <i>Bodies</i> of his
best <i>Troops</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> therefore rais’d the Siege, with this
Pretence, That <i>he did not come to besiege</i> Vienna,
<i>but to meet with</i> Ferdinand <i>King of</i>
Hungary, <i>to fight with him for his Dominions</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">(15)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Year he <i>circumcised</i><a name="FNanchor_M_12" id="FNanchor_M_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_12" class="fnanchor">(M)</a>
his three Sons, <i>Mustapha</i>, that he had by a
<i>Circassian</i><a name="FNanchor_N_13" id="FNanchor_N_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_13" class="fnanchor">(N)</a> Slave, <i>Mahomet</i> and <i>Selimus</i>,
by two other Slaves of the <i>Seraglio</i><a name="FNanchor_O_14" id="FNanchor_O_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_14" class="fnanchor">(O)</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">(16)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Year 1532 <i>Solyman</i> made another
Expedition into <i>Hungary</i>: He invested<a name="FNanchor_P_15" id="FNanchor_P_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_15" class="fnanchor">(P)</a>
<i>Guntz</i>; but it was so well defended by its
Governor, the valiant <i>Nicholas Turischitz</i>,
that Solyman abandon’d the Siege.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> by long Marches, sate down
before <i>Gratz</i><a name="FNanchor_Q_16" id="FNanchor_Q_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_16" class="fnanchor">(Q)</a>, but hearing of a powerful
Army headed by <i>Charles</i> V, and <i>Ferdinand</i>
his Brother, he thought fit to march back
to <i>Constantinople</i>, after the Loss of a great
Number of Troops, commanded by <i>Bassa
Fereses</i>, and <i>Cæsan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Year 1514, <i>Solyman</i> sent <i>Barbarossa</i>
the <i>Pyrate</i>, then in league with him,
to invade <i>Africa</i>, where he did much mischief
both in Africa, and the Sea-coasts of
<i>Italy</i>, and the <i>Islands</i> of the <i>Mediterranean</i>.
He after conquer’d the Kingdom of<a name="FNanchor_R_17" id="FNanchor_R_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_17" class="fnanchor">(R)</a> <i>Tunis</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">(17)</a></span>and by his Arts as well as Arms caus’d
himself to be proclaim’d King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span>, by the Persuasion of <i>Ibrahim
Bassa</i>, this Year undertook his War against
<i>Persia</i>, attended by his Son <i>Mustapha</i>, now
about thirteen Years of Age, where he first
trod in the Paths of War. The Rendezvous
of the Army was at the City of <i>Nice</i><a name="FNanchor_S_18" id="FNanchor_S_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_18" class="fnanchor">(S)</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> thence he dispatch’d <i>Ibrahim</i> and
<i>Ulemas</i> with a strong Army to ravage <i>Syria</i>,
where they took <i>Tauris</i><a name="FNanchor_T_19" id="FNanchor_T_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_19" class="fnanchor">(T)</a> from King <i>Damas</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">(18)</a></span>But these Generals being advertiz’d
of great Preparations against them, inform’d
<i>Solyman</i> of it, who came to their Relief with
the utmost Expedition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> <i>Solyman</i> was in his March to meet
the Enemy, being encamp’d in a vast Plain,
there rose such a violent Storm in the Night
of Rain, Hail and Snow, from the adjacent
Mountains, that Men and Beasts of Carriage
were smother’d, many of the Soldiers
perish’d to death in their Tents, even <i>Solyman</i>’s
Pavilion was near being wash’d away.
The superstitious Soldiers imagin’d it was a
Storm rais’d by the <i>Magicians</i> of <i>Persia</i>, and
murmur’d at a War as waged against Heaven,
expeding in the Dark (for the Storm
had extinguish’d all their Fires) the Enemy
would come upon them, and destroy them
all; but the approaching Day dissipated
that Fear with the End of the Storm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next Day <i>Solyman</i> march’d towards
<i>Babylon</i><a name="FNanchor_U_20" id="FNanchor_U_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_20" class="fnanchor">(U)</a>, whose Governor being fled for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">(19)</a></span>Fear, (not being provided for a Siege) the
City was peaceably surrender’d to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> then proceeded to retake <i>Tauris</i>, that
<i>Damas</i> had recover’d from the <i>Turks</i>; but
<i>Damas</i> fled at the Approach of <i>Solyman</i>,
which so much enrag’d him (because he
could not bring him to a Battle) that he
gave that opulent City to the Plunder of
his Soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> <i>Solyman</i> was continuing his March to
destroy the Country, a Party of <i>Damas</i>’s
Horse, commanded by <i>Delimonthes</i>, one of
his Generals, set upon the Rear of <i>Solyman</i>’s
Army (who was some Leagues before ’em)
in the Night, and made a prodigious
Slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Overthrow grieved <i>Solyman</i> sorely,
insomuch that he order’d his Army to return,
very much disgusted with <i>Ibrahim</i>
<i>Bassa</i>, that advis’d him to this Expedition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Disgust was heighten’d by <i>Roxolana</i>,
because <i>Ibrahim</i> was in <i>Mustapha</i>’s
Interest, which was contrary to her own.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">(20)</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> had given his Oath and Promise
to <i>Ibrahim</i>, he should never be kill’d
while he liv’d. But inviting him to a solemn
Supper, he that Night had his Throat
cut while he slept; <i>Solyman</i> pretending he
had not broke his Oath, because he was
kill’d while he slept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> <i>Mustapha</i> began to be a Follower
of <i>Mars</i>, and perform’d so many noble Acts,
that he was the only Joy of his Father, who
intended him his Successor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ambitious <i>Roxolana</i>, alarm’d at the
tender Love <i>Solyman</i> bore <i>Mustapha</i>, was
resolv’d to ruin him in his favour; she
therefore by an Over-praise first made the
<i>Sultan</i> believe, she had an entire Affection
for him, that she might better work her
Design upon him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> would by a vile Insinuation, tell the
Sultan, how happy he was in a Son, so
brave and valiant, that had gain’d the Hearts
of all the prime Men in the Empire, as well
as the entire Love of the Soldiers; hinting
that it was well <i>Mustapha</i>’s Duty, and Love
to his Father, would prevent his making a
wrong use of it, throwing in by-the-by,
that many Sons had murder’d their Fathers
to get their Thrones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">(21)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> Speeches, often back’d by <i>Rustan</i>,
the Grand Vizir, and the Mufti, (the Pope
of the Turks) began to alarm <i>Solyman</i>, whose
Weakness made him forget by Degrees the
amiable Qualities of <i>Mustapha</i>. This Opinion
was strengthen’d by his secret League
with the <i>Persian</i>, whom the <i>Turks</i> esteem
as <i>Hereticks</i>, preferring <i>Hali</i> before <i>Mahomet</i>
their Prophet, which Difference may
be compar’d to the <i>Protestant</i> and <i>Catholick</i>
Religions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> had four Sons by <i>Roxolana</i>,
<i>Mahomet</i>, <i>Selimus</i>, (who after succeeded his
Father) <i>Bajazet</i> and <i>Tzianger</i>, (whom our
Author calls Zanger).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zanger</span> had contracted a strict Union
of Love and Friendship with <i>Mustapha</i>, and
<i>Roxolana</i> lov’d <i>Zanger</i> beyond her other
Sons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> not being the <i>Sultana Queen</i><a name="FNanchor_W_21" id="FNanchor_W_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_21" class="fnanchor">(W)</a>,
that is, not wedded to the <i>Sultan</i>, she
fear’d the more, that at the Death of <i>Solyman</i>,
<i>Mustapha</i> would be Emperor, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">(22)</a></span>then, as the Custom was among the <i>Turks</i>,
when they a ascend the Throne, the whole
Blood that were Males would he put to
Death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mustapha</span> was by her Desire sent to
<i>Caramania</i><a name="FNanchor_X_22" id="FNanchor_X_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_22" class="fnanchor">(X)</a>, that she might pursue her Designs
to his Ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing she had to do was to
prevail on the Emperor to wed her; for being
his Queen, would effectually disinherit
(as we say) <i>Mustapha</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> bring this about, she took it in her
head to be very religious, built an Hospital,
and a Church. When these were finih’d,
she ask’d the <i>Mufti</i> if such Acts of Charity
would not be grateful to Heaven! and be a
Means to save her precious Soul! The good
Mufti (receiving a Bribe before-hand, for
there is Bribery and Corruption in <i>Turkey</i> as
well as other Places) reply’d, her Soul would
not be a Grain the better for it, because she
was a Slave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> afflicted the good <i>Roxolana</i> in a
surprising manner; She would not take any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">(23)</a></span>Nourishment; her Eyes were ever in Tears,
and her Heart heav’d with Sighs every Moment
(I mean when she was in the Presence
of <i>Solyman</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> good Emperor (for he lov’d her
sincerely) could not bear to see her Tears,
therefore order’d her to be made free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> this Part of her Plot had succeded
she put on all her Charms again, and
seem’d the most satisfy’d happy Lady in the
World.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few Days after her Manumission,
the <i>Emperor</i> sent his chief <i>Eunuch</i>, to fetch
her to his <i>Bed-Chamber</i>: The pious Lady
came, but with Hands up-lifted, with an
<i>Alcoran</i> held fast between them, told the
Emperor, she could not be so happy to
partake of the Honour of his Bed now she
was no more a Slave, but she would consult
the Mufti, and if he could dispense with it,
she would with the utmost Joy comply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Mufti</i>, who knew what he was to
do, declar’d she could never enter <i>Mahomet</i>’s
<i>Paradise</i>, if she yielded to the Emperor’s
Desires without being his Wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor, well satisfy’d with the
<i>Mufti</i>’s Answer, had the Marriage-Rites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">(24)</a></span>
perform’d, and gave her 5000 <i>Sultana</i>’s for
her pearly Dowry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> satisfy’d so far, she now proceeded
to procure the Death of <i>Mustapha</i>. She
got counterfeit Letters convey’d to the Sultan,
that shew’d that <i>innocent</i> Prince in a <i>false</i> and
<i>guilty</i> Light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this not having the quick Effect
she wish’d, she endeavour’d to cut him off
by Poison, but to no purpose, for he escap’d
the Trap. She at last procur’d a Letter that
<i>Mustapha</i> was contracted to the Daughter
of the King of <i>Persia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> wrought so much upon <i>Solyman</i>,
that he dwelt no longer upon the Ruin of
his Son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to this he sent <i>Ruftan</i> with an
Army to fetch his Son. But finding the
Prince prepar’d for him, he return’d,
told <i>Solyman</i>, he was so belov’d by the
Army he commanded, that he thought it Prudence
to return as he went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> so inrag’d the Emperor, that he
went in Person with an Army to <i>Aleppo</i><a name="FNanchor_Y_23" id="FNanchor_Y_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_23" class="fnanchor">(Y)</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">(25)</a></span>where he sent for the <i>unfortunate Prince</i>;
and notwithstanding he was forewarn’d of
his Danger, yet he resolv’d to pay Obedience
to his Father’s Commands. When
he was near the City the crafty <i>Rustan</i> sent
several great Officers with the <i>Janizaries</i> to
meet him, and then insinuated to the Emperor
the Love the People bore him in going
in Crouds to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mustapha</span> approach’d his Father’s Tent
with few of his Followers: At the Entrance
he threw by his Dagger, as the Custom is
when any Person enters the Tent of the
<i>Sultan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he had enter’d the inmost Part of
the Pavilion, he found but a single <i>Sofa</i> to
sit on, which he took for an ill Omen.
An Attendant coming in, he ask’d where
the Emperor was, who reply’d he would
see him presently. The <i>Prince</i> was melancholy,
well knowing his Death was approaching;
and a few Moments after, the
Mutes enter’d and strangled him. The Emperor
himself, through another Part of the
Tent, beheld the fatal Spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was so hopeful a Prince, that the
Turks, even to this Day, often say, <i>Gietti
Sultan Mustapha</i>, that is, <i>Our Hope is lost
in</i> Mustapha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">(26)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the cruel Murder was perform’d,
the Emperor met <i>Zanger</i> at the Door of the
Pavilion, enquiring for his dear <i>Mustapha</i>!
The Emperor bid him enter to the inward
Tent, and he would find him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> when the noble <i>Zanger</i> saw him
breathless, he cry’d out to hit unnatural <i>Father</i>;
<i>How could it enter into thy cruel
Heart to murder so sweet a Prince!</i> Then
drawing a Ponyard from his Side, plung’d
it in his Heart, and expir’d upon the breathless
Body of his dear Brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> fell two worthy Princes, that might
have grac’d with their Virtue and Courage
(had they liv’d) the Annals of the <i>Turkish</i>
Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Troops were acquainted with
the Death of <i>Mustapha</i> and <i>Zanger</i>, they
assembled in a tumultuous Manner to avenge
his Death: <i>Achmetes</i> the Tutor to <i>Mustapha</i>
led them on. <i>Solyman</i>, to appease their
Rage, disgrac’d <i>Rustan</i>, turn’d him out of
all his Posts, and conferr’d them on <i>Achmetes</i>,
with a Promise never to displace him;
but <i>Rustan</i>, assisted by the artful <i>Roxolana</i>,
procur’d the Death of <i>Achmetes</i>, and was by
the Emperor restor’d to all his former Honours,
and by him more esteem’d than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">(27)</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mustapha</span> was so well beloved, that a
false <i>Mustapha</i> appear’d, and was follow’d
by the Malecontents till he had gather’d a
powerful Army, But the Threats of <i>Solyman</i>
intimidated his Troops to such a Degree,
that they forsook their false General,
who was taken Prisoner, and carry’d to <i>Constantinople</i>,
where the Emperor by torture
made him confess that <i>Bajazet</i>, his Son by
<i>Roxolana</i>, had put him upon the false and
fatal Enterprize. <i>Roxolana</i> had <i>Selimus</i>, another
Son, by <i>Solyman</i>; and after the Death
of the two unfortunate Princes <i>Mustapha</i>
and <i>Zanger</i>, the Sultan seem’d most to favour
<i>Selimus</i>, but <i>Roxolana</i>, <i>Bajazet</i>. But
it was with much Difficulty she gain’d his
Pardon from the Emperor his Father, for
his promoting a false <i>Mustapha</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> to the last of his Life regretted
the Loss of his <i>Mustapha</i> and <i>Zanger</i>.
He died of a Consumption after gaining
many Victories, in the Year 1566, the 14th
of <i>September</i>, in the 76th Year of his Age,
and the 46th Year of his Reign. As to his
Person; he was of an advantageous Height,
well made, but pale, his Nose long and
hooked, more faithful to his Promise than
most of his Predecessors, and wanted not
many Virtues to form a good Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">(28)</a></span></p>

<p>I can’t help ending the Trifle, with congratulating
the Author of the Play with his
Success, which is owing to his Conduct in
the Story, the many beautiful Sentiments,
and the Correctness of his Poetry. I was
pleas’d the first Night not to find those
<i>Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i>, that (like stabbing Men
in the Dark) assassinate without the least
Mercy.</p>

in <i>the Harbour</i> between its Legs: it was seventy Cubits
high. The Brass of this Statue, (after it was thrown

Ceremony, till the male Child is upwards of seven
Years old. The Operator is a Surgeon. When the
Child is recover’d of his Wound, he is placed on
horseback, and led through the chief Streets of the
Town, attended by the <i>Iman</i> (or <i>Priest</i>) with Children
of its own Age. Till the Child is perfectly
cured, the Parents make a great Feast, inviting their
Relations and Acquaintance to partake of their Mirth.
Grown People, or those that turn from the Christian
Religion (called Renegadoes) ride in triumph, with

the nature of Baptism with the Christians.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
