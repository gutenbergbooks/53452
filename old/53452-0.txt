THE

HISTORY

OF

Solyman the Magnificent, and Mustapha his Son.


As the Town has been so agreeably entertain’d with the
Tragedy of Mustapha, written by the celebrated Author of Eurydice, and
other valuable Pieces, I think it will not be amiss to give a short
Account of the Life and Actions of _Solyman_, the Father of _Mustapha_,
mix’d with those of that unfortunate Prince, who gives Title to the
Play.

Solyman the Magnificent, (Father to _Mustapha_, by a beautiful
_Circassian_ Slave, and _Tzianger_, by the ambitious _Roxolana_) was
one of the most potent Princes of the _Othoman Race_: He was the Son
of _Selimus_, who died in the midst of his Victories, upon the Road
to Adrianople, of a _Cancer_ in his Reins, in September 1520, when
_Charles_ V. was Emperor of _Germany_, _Henry_ VIII. King of _England_,
_Francis_ I. King of France, _James_ V. King of _Scotland_, and _Leo_
X. Pope of Rome.

At the Time of his Father’s Death, _Solyman_ was at _Magnesia_[A], and
receiving Notice of his Father’s Death from _Ferhates Bassa_, only,
(as _Selimus_ his Father had formerly attempted to poison him, fearing
his amiable Qualities) gave little Credit to the Information: But when
he received the Confirmation from _Pyrrhus_, and _Mustapha_, _Bassas_
at Adrianople, he ventur’d to Scutari[B], where he was met by the
_Aga_ of the _Janizaries_[C], and Numbers of the People, (yet ignorant
of the Death of _Selimus_) from whence he was conducted over to
_Constantinople_[D], where the Body of the _Janizaries_ were prepar’d
on the Shore to meet him.

The Moment he landed, the _Aga_ cry’d with a loud Voice, _Behold_ your
_Emperor_ Solyman! The _Janizaries_, transported with Joy, reply’d with
one Voice, Long live Solyman, our great Emperor!

Solyman was in his Twentieth Year, when he was first seated in
the Turkish _Throne_; and for several Years reign’d as a _benign
Prince_. But being corrupted by the Artifices of _Roxolana_, and the
impious Designs of _Rustan_ his Grand Vizir, who wedded a Daughter of
_Roxolana_’s, began to dip his Hands in Blood.

However he perform’d many glorious Actions at the Head of his own
Armies.

The first Year of his Reign, he took from _Lewis_ King of _Hungary_, a
peaceable Prince, the strong City of _Belgrade_[E].

He afterwards turn’d his Arms against the City of _Rhodes_. I shall be
something particular in this Siege, because our Countrymen had a hand
in bravely defending the place.

Solyman was not present at the first investing of[F] _Rhodes_; but
his Troops being often beat by the Besieged, and losing above forty
Thousand of his Soldiers, (tho’ the _Rhodians_ were not six Thousand
fighting Men) be repair’d to the Camp to encourage his Troops.

The Emperor’s Arrival gave new life to his fainting Army; and
perceiving the _English_ Bulwark annoy’d him most, sprung a Mine, that
blew many a brave _Englishman_ to Immortality.

The Turks upon this Success, with loud Shouts attack’d the Breach;
but the Grand Master, _Philip Vellinus_, at the Head of the remaining
_English_, repuls’d them, with the Loss of two Thousand _Janizaries_.

The Cannon of the Besieged did great Execution among the _Turks_, and
their being often repuls’d, gave _Solyman_ but little Hopes of gaining
the City by Force; for even the Women of all Degrees threw down Stones
from the Battlements on the Heads of the Besiegers, when they came to
scale their Walls.

Solyman, after musing alone in his Tent, sent for all his chief
Commanders, and told them he would make one general Assault; and if the
City was taken, the Troops should be rewarded with the Plunder.

A poor Christian Slave hearing the Proclamation to the Troops, found
Means to let the _Rhodians_ know of _Solyman_’s Design for the next Day.

The _Grand Master_ (at this Notice) prepar’d every thing to oppose them.

The next Morning before Break of Day, the _Turks_ attack’d the City
with loud _Tecbirs_, or Shouts of _Onset_, in five several Places
at once with fifty Thousand Men. The Enemy was repuls’d with great
Slaughter from the _English_ and _Italian_ Quarter. But in the mean
time _Mustapha_ Bassa, and _Achmetes_ Bassa, attack’d the _Spanish_
Bulwark, (whose Defenders were three parts gone to assist the _Italian_
and _English_) and soon became Masters of it.

But the _Grand Master_, with several Knights of the Order, retook it
again, after an obstinate Defence, with the Death of all the _Turks_.

This Success gave new Life to the _Rhodians_, who every where repuls’d
their Enemies.

Solyman on a neighbouring Hill saw all with the utmost Vexation of
Mind, and seeing no Hope of Success, order’d a Retreat to be sounded:
The harrass’d Troops retir’d to their Camp, leaving above twenty
Thousand of their Fellows lifeless behind them, as a Token of the
Valour of their Enemies.

This ill Success so provok’d _Solyman_, that he gave Orders that
_Mustapha Bassa_ should immediately be put to death, tho’ he had done
all in the Assault a wise and brave General could do.

Pyrrhus _Bassa_ hearing of this severe Command, notwithstanding
_Solyman_’s Rage, went to intercede for him; but his Rage continuing,
he order’d _Pyrrhus_ to undergo the same Fate.

The rest of his Council fell at his Feet to hinder so cruel a Command,
some begging to suffer with them, vowing never to rise till their
honest Suit was granted.

The Emperor’s Passion at last subsiding, he pardon’d _Mustapha_ and
_Pyrrhus_.

However, his Admiral, because he could not prevent the Relief that
came by Sea into the Town, did not fare quite so well. He was order’d
to receive the Bastinado (or Scourging) as a common Slave, on board
his own Galley, and had been put to death, but for the Persuasion of
_Achmetes Bassa_, who had a great Influence over _Solyman_.

The _Emperor’s_ ill Success began to make him turn his Thoughts from
the Siege, tho’ with the utmost Reluctance; to see the Course of his
victorious Arms stopp’d by a handful of Men, was what his ambitious
Soul could not bear.

He summon’d another Council of War of all his grand Officers, where,
after many Debates, he was persuaded to continue the Siege, and by the
Strength of their Vows and Promises to conquer, he began to build him
a Palace on the Brow of Mount _Philermus_, where from the Battlements
he could take a View of what was done in the City of _Rhodes_. But
the Gross of the _Turkish_ Army murmur’d at the Continuance of the
Siege, shot Letters upon the Heads of Arrows frequently into the Town
discovering every thing that was done in Council, with Promise of the
Revolt of _Mustapha Bassa_ for the ill Usage he had receiv’d from the
Emperor _Solyman_.

But notwithstanding the Valour of the _Rhodians_, (who twice more
repuls’d the _Othomans_ with great Slaughter) they began to want every
thing that was necessary: And by eager Persuasions of the Inhabitants
that had Families in the City, he was prevail’d upon to send an Embassy
to _Solyman_, tho’ not before the _Turks_ had gain’d two hundred Paces
in Breadth, and a hundred and fifty in Length, within the outward Wall.

When the _Ambassador_ came before _Solyman_, he demanded the immediate
Surrender of the City; and if the _Rhodians_ would trust his Clemency,
now, without farther Hostilities, their Lives, Estates and Freedoms
should be safe.

Solyman imagining these Promises would prevail upon the harrass’d
_Rhodians_, sent a Letter to the same purpose to be read in publick to
them by a _Genoese_.

When the Letter was read, the Grand Master was of the opinion to hold
out the Siege to the last: But a _Greek Priest_, with Tears running
down his Cheeks, begg’d he would prevent the final Destruction of
so many innocent People; at the same time praising the Clemency of
_Solyman_ to those that yielded to his Arms.

He was constrain’d to comply with their Desires, and surrender’d the
City to the Emperor, who enter’d in Triumph on the 25th of _December_
1522.

In the Year 1526, _Solyman_ turn’d his Arms against _Hungary_, with an
Army of two hundred thousand Men, and advanc’d as far as _Sophia_[G],
before the indolent _Lewis_ King of _Hungary_ heard of his March.

At _Mohatz_[H] the young King met _Solyman_’s Army with twenty-five
thousand Men, and by ill Persuasion gave Battle on the 29th of
_October_ 1528, and his Army was defeated. _Lewis_ endeavouring to make
his Escape, was smother’d in a Ditch where his Horse had plung’d him.

Solyman did nothing extraordinary in the military Way till the Spring
1529, When the Fame of his Arms made the strong City _Buda_[I] an
easy Conquest; for the Inhabitants, struck with in universal Terror,
abandon’d the Place, and he enter’d the empty _City_ in _Triumph_.
But the _Citadel_ Was bravely defended by the Governor, _Thomas
Nadasti_, till the Garrison was reduc’d to three hundred; who seiz’d
the Governor, to deliver him up to _Solyman_, upon Condition they were
to march out with Bag and Baggage. But _Solyman_ despising their
Trachery, order’d his _Janizaries_ to put the Soldiers to Death, and
dismiss’d the _Governor_ with magnificent Presents, for the Revard of
his Valour, and Integrity to his Prince.

After the taking of _Buda_, _Solyman_ was resolv’d to penetrate into
the Heart of _Germany_, and lay siege to the City of[K] _Vienna_, the
capital City of _Austria_.

In his March he suffer’d his Troops to commit all Sorts of Outrages,
destroying all the Country with Fire and Sword, even beyond _Vienna_,
as far as _Lintz_[L]. He encamp’d before the City, _September_ the
26th, 1529, and invested it, that no Succour could be sent into the
Town.

He sent word by several Prisoners he had taken, that it was in vain to
defend their _Walls_ against the vindictive Force that had conquer’d
_Rhodes_, _Belgrade_ and _Buda_. But receiving no Answer, but _Sallies_
from the city, he began to plant his _Cannon_, and batter the _Walls_,
tho’ without Success; for his heavy Cannon, with the Vessels that
bore them, were sunk in the _Danube_ by the brave _Wolfgang Hoder_,
Commander of the Grand Duke’s Galleys. This unexpected Misfortune
gave _Solyman_, not only Uneasiness, but Terror, which was augmented
by Reports, that all the Powers of _Germany_ were marching to protect
_Vienna_.

In every Assault he seem’d to have the worst; all his _Mines_ were
_countermined_, and blown up, with considerable _Bodies_ of his best
_Troops_.

He therefore rais’d the Siege, with this Pretence, That _he did not
come to besiege_ Vienna, _but to meet with_ Ferdinand _King of_
Hungary, _to fight with him for his Dominions_.

The following Year he _circumcised_[M] his three Sons, _Mustapha_, that
he had by a _Circassian_[N] Slave, _Mahomet_ and _Selimus_, by two
other Slaves of the _Seraglio_[O].

In the Year 1532 _Solyman_ made another Expedition into _Hungary_: He
invested[P] _Guntz_; but it was so well defended by its Governor, the
valiant _Nicholas Turischitz_, that Solyman abandon’d the Siege.

Solyman by long Marches, sate down before _Gratz_[Q], but hearing of
a powerful Army headed by _Charles_ V, and _Ferdinand_ his Brother,
he thought fit to march back to _Constantinople_, after the Loss of a
great Number of Troops, commanded by _Bassa Fereses_, and _Cæsan_.

In the Year 1514, _Solyman_ sent _Barbarossa_ the _Pyrate_, then in
league with him, to invade _Africa_, where he did much mischief both
in Africa, and the Sea-coasts of _Italy_, and the _Islands_ of the
_Mediterranean_. He after conquer’d the Kingdom of[R] _Tunis_ and by
his Arts as well as Arms caus’d himself to be proclaim’d King.

Solyman, by the Persuasion of _Ibrahim Bassa_, this Year undertook
his War against _Persia_, attended by his Son _Mustapha_, now about
thirteen Years of Age, where he first trod in the Paths of War. The
Rendezvous of the Army was at the City of _Nice_[S]

From thence he dispatch’d _Ibrahim_ and _Ulemas_ with a strong Army
to ravage _Syria_, where they took _Tauris_[T] from King _Damas_ But
these Generals being advertiz’d of great Preparations against them,
inform’d _Solyman_ of it, who came to their Relief with the utmost
Expedition.

As _Solyman_ was in his March to meet the Enemy, being encamp’d in a
vast Plain, there rose such a violent Storm in the Night of Rain, Hail
and Snow, from the adjacent Mountains, that Men and Beasts of Carriage
were smother’d, many of the Soldiers perish’d to death in their Tents,
even _Solyman_’s Pavilion was near being wash’d away. The superstitious
Soldiers imagin’d it was a Storm rais’d by the _Magicians_ of _Persia_,
and murmur’d at a War as waged against Heaven, expeding in the Dark
(for the Storm had extinguish’d all their Fires) the Enemy would come
upon them, and destroy them all; but the approaching Day dissipated
that Fear with the End of the Storm.

The next Day _Solyman_ march’d towards _Babylon_[U], whose Governor
being fled for Fear, (not being provided for a Siege) the City was
peaceably surrender’d to him.

He then proceeded to retake _Tauris_, that _Damas_ had recover’d from
the _Turks_; but _Damas_ fled at the Approach of _Solyman_, which so
much enrag’d him (because he could not bring him to a Battle) that he
gave that opulent City to the Plunder of his Soldiers.

As _Solyman_ was continuing his March to destroy the Country, a Party
of _Damas_’s Horse, commanded by _Delimonthes_, one of his Generals,
set upon the Rear of _Solyman_’s Army (who was some Leagues before ’em)
in the Night, and made a prodigious Slaughter.

This Overthrow grieved _Solyman_ sorely, insomuch that he order’d
his Army to return, very much disgusted with _Ibrahim Bassa_, that
advis’d him to this Expedition.

This Disgust was heighten’d by _Roxolana_, because _Ibrahim_ was in
_Mustapha_’s Interest, which was contrary to her own.

Solyman had given his Oath and Promise to _Ibrahim_, he should never
be kill’d while he liv’d. But inviting him to a solemn Supper, he that
Night had his Throat cut while he slept; _Solyman_ pretending he had
not broke his Oath, because he was kill’d while he slept.

Now _Mustapha_ began to be a Follower of _Mars_, and perform’d so many
noble Acts, that he was the only Joy of his Father, who intended him
his Successor.

The ambitious _Roxolana_, alarm’d at the tender Love _Solyman_ bore
_Mustapha_, was resolv’d to ruin him in his favour; she therefore by
an Over-praise first made the _Sultan_ believe, she had an entire
Affection for him, that she might better work her Design upon him.

She would by a vile Insinuation, tell the Sultan, how happy he was in a
Son, so brave and valiant, that had gain’d the Hearts of all the prime
Men in the Empire, as well as the entire Love of the Soldiers; hinting
that it was well _Mustapha_’s Duty, and Love to his Father, would
prevent his making a wrong use of it, throwing in by-the-by, that many
Sons had murder’d their Fathers to get their Thrones.

These Speeches, often back’d by _Rustan_, the Grand Vizir, and the
Mufti, (the Pope of the Turks) began to alarm _Solyman_, whose Weakness
made him forget by Degrees the amiable Qualities of _Mustapha_. This
Opinion was strengthen’d by his secret League with the _Persian_, whom
the _Turks_ esteem as _Hereticks_, preferring _Hali_ before _Mahomet_
their Prophet, which Difference may be compar’d to the _Protestant_ and
_Catholick_ Religions.

Solyman had four Sons by _Roxolana_, _Mahomet_, _Selimus_, (who after
succeeded his Father) _Bajazet_ and _Tzianger_, (whom our Author calls
Zanger).

Zanger had contracted a strict Union of Love and Friendship with
_Mustapha_, and _Roxolana_ lov’d _Zanger_ beyond her other Sons.

But not being the _Sultana Queen_[W], that is, not wedded to the
_Sultan_, she fear’d the more, that at the Death of _Solyman_,
_Mustapha_ would be Emperor, and then, as the Custom was among the
_Turks_, when they a ascend the Throne, the whole Blood that were Males
would he put to Death.

Mustapha was by her Desire sent to _Caramania_[X], that she might
pursue her Designs to his Ruin.

The first thing she had to do was to prevail on the Emperor to wed
her; for being his Queen, would effectually disinherit (as we say)
_Mustapha_.

To bring this about, she took it in her head to be very religious,
built an Hospital, and a Church. When these were finih’d, she ask’d the
_Mufti_ if such Acts of Charity would not be grateful to Heaven! and be
a Means to save her precious Soul! The good Mufti (receiving a Bribe
before-hand, for there is Bribery and Corruption in _Turkey_ as well as
other Places) reply’d, her Soul would not be a Grain the better for it,
because she was a Slave.

This afflicted the good _Roxolana_ in a surprising manner; She would
not take any Nourishment; her Eyes were ever in Tears, and her Heart
heav’d with Sighs every Moment (I mean when she was in the Presence of
_Solyman_.)

The good Emperor (for he lov’d her sincerely) could not bear to see her
Tears, therefore order’d her to be made free.

When this Part of her Plot had succeded she put on all her Charms
again, and seem’d the most satisfy’d happy Lady in the World.

In a few Days after her Manumission, the _Emperor_ sent his chief
_Eunuch_, to fetch her to his _Bed-Chamber_: The pious Lady came, but
with Hands up-lifted, with an _Alcoran_ held fast between them, told
the Emperor, she could not be so happy to partake of the Honour of his
Bed now she was no more a Slave, but she would consult the Mufti, and
if he could dispense with it, she would with the utmost Joy comply.

The _Mufti_, who knew what he was to do, declar’d she could never enter
_Mahomet_’s _Paradise_, if she yielded to the Emperor’s Desires without
being his Wife.

The Emperor, well satisfy’d with the _Mufti_’s Answer, had the
Marriage-Rites perform’d, and gave her 5000 _Sultana_’s for her pearly
Dowry.

Being satisfy’d so far, she now proceeded to procure the Death of
_Mustapha_. She got counterfeit Letters convey’d to the Sultan, that
shew’d that _innocent_ Prince in a _false_ and _guilty_ Light.

But this not having the quick Effect she wish’d, she endeavour’d to cut
him off by Poison, but to no purpose, for he escap’d the Trap. She at
last procur’d a Letter that _Mustapha_ was contracted to the Daughter
of the King of _Persia_.

This wrought so much upon _Solyman_, that he dwelt no longer upon the
Ruin of his Son.

In order to this he sent _Ruftan_ with an Army to fetch his Son. But
finding the Prince prepar’d for him, he return’d, told _Solyman_, he
was so belov’d by the Army he commanded, that he thought it Prudence to
return as he went.

This so inrag’d the Emperor, that he went in Person with an Army
to _Aleppo_[Y], where he sent for the _unfortunate Prince_; and
notwithstanding he was forewarn’d of his Danger, yet he resolv’d to
pay Obedience to his Father’s Commands. When he was near the City the
crafty _Rustan_ sent several great Officers with the _Janizaries_ to
meet him, and then insinuated to the Emperor the Love the People bore
him in going in Crouds to meet him.

Mustapha approach’d his Father’s Tent with few of his Followers: At
the Entrance he threw by his Dagger, as the Custom is when any Person
enters the Tent of the _Sultan_.

When he had enter’d the inmost Part of the Pavilion, he found but a
single _Sofa_ to sit on, which he took for an ill Omen. An Attendant
coming in, he ask’d where the Emperor was, who reply’d he would see
him presently. The _Prince_ was melancholy, well knowing his Death was
approaching; and a few Moments after, the Mutes enter’d and strangled
him. The Emperor himself, through another Part of the Tent, beheld the
fatal Spectacle.

He was so hopeful a Prince, that the Turks, even to this Day, often
say, _Gietti Sultan Mustapha_, that is, _Our Hope is lost in_ Mustapha.

When the cruel Murder was perform’d, the Emperor met _Zanger_ at the
Door of the Pavilion, enquiring for his dear _Mustapha_! The Emperor
bid him enter to the inward Tent, and he would find him.

But when the noble _Zanger_ saw him breathless, he cry’d out to hit
unnatural _Father_; _How could it enter into thy cruel Heart to murder
so sweet a Prince!_ Then drawing a Ponyard from his Side, plung’d it in
his Heart, and expir’d upon the breathless Body of his dear Brother.

Thus fell two worthy Princes, that might have grac’d with their Virtue
and Courage (had they liv’d) the Annals of the _Turkish_ Empire.

When the Troops were acquainted with the Death of _Mustapha_ and
_Zanger_, they assembled in a tumultuous Manner to avenge his Death:
_Achmetes_ the Tutor to _Mustapha_ led them on. _Solyman_, to appease
their Rage, disgrac’d _Rustan_, turn’d him out of all his Posts, and
conferr’d them on _Achmetes_, with a Promise never to displace him;
but _Rustan_, assisted by the artful _Roxolana_, procur’d the Death of
_Achmetes_, and was by the Emperor restor’d to all his former Honours,
and by him more esteem’d than ever.

Mustapha was so well beloved, that a false _Mustapha_ appear’d, and was
follow’d by the Malecontents till he had gather’d a powerful Army, But
the Threats of _Solyman_ intimidated his Troops to such a Degree, that
they forsook their false General, who was taken Prisoner, and carry’d
to _Constantinople_, where the Emperor by torture made him confess that
_Bajazet_, his Son by _Roxolana_, had put him upon the false and fatal
Enterprize. _Roxolana_ had _Selimus_, another Son, by _Solyman_; and
after the Death of the two unfortunate Princes _Mustapha_ and _Zanger_,
the Sultan seem’d most to favour _Selimus_, but _Roxolana_, _Bajazet_.
But it was with much Difficulty she gain’d his Pardon from the Emperor
his Father, for his promoting a false _Mustapha_.

Solyman to the last of his Life regretted the Loss of his _Mustapha_
and _Zanger_. He died of a Consumption after gaining many Victories,
in the Year 1566, the 14th of _September_, in the 76th Year of his
Age, and the 46th Year of his Reign. As to his Person; he was of an
advantageous Height, well made, but pale, his Nose long and hooked,
more faithful to his Promise than most of his Predecessors, and wanted
not many Virtues to form a good Prince.

I can’t help ending the Trifle, with congratulating the Author of the
Play with his Success, which is owing to his Conduct in the Story, the
many beautiful Sentiments, and the Correctness of his Poetry. I was
pleas’d the first Night not to find those _Goths_ and _Vandals_, that
(like stabbing Men in the Dark) assassinate without the least Mercy.

some Authors called _Mangresia_ situated near the celebrated River
Mæander, from whence it was called Magnesia ad Mæendrum to
distinguish it from other Cities of the same name. It is situate about
a Degree (or twenty Leagues) north-east from Symirna and half a Degree
from the ancient City of Ephesus, famous for the _Temple of Diana_, The
great General Themistocles was banish’d to _Magnesia_ and died there in
his Banishment.

[B] _Scutari_, a Town in the _Lesser Asia_, over-agaist
_Constantinople_, as Southwark is to London, only the _Bosphorus_ is
thrice at broad between _Scutary_ and _Constantinople_; by some Authors
supposed to be built out of the Ruins of the ancient Chalcedon.

[C] _Aga_ of the _Janizaries_, that is _General_ of the _first_ warlike
_Body_ of the _Empire_. In former times, they were composed of the
_Sons_ of _Christian Slaves_, but now they are augmented in a great
Body, upwards of an hundred thousand Men, that have by their number
the disposal of the _Turkish Empire_, and are very willing for a _new_
Change; for generally the Successor of the Empire, at his ascending the
throne, gives this body of Troops a Largess or Present, that as soon as
receiv’d makes them willing to with another Emperor.

[D] _Constantinople_, by the _Turks_ called _Stamboul_, (formerly
_Byzantium_) took its name from _Constantine_ the _Great_, who himself
gave it the name of _New Rome_; where he _establish’d a Senate_, with
every other _Constitution_, according to _ancient Rome_.

[E] _Belgrade_ (the ancient _Alba Græca_) built on the River Save,
near its Fall into the Danube, is the Capital of _Rascia_, a Province
of Hungary; it has often chang’d its Masters, though for many ages the
_Bulwark_ of the _Christians_ against the Othomans. _Amurath_ II. lost
the best part of his Army before it. His Son _Mahomet_ was forced to
raise the Siege with infinite loss, by a _Stratagem_ of the heroick
_John Huniades_. He suffer’d a large Body of the Enemy to enter the
Town, who immediately fell to plundering; in the mean time, he made a
Tally upon the remaining Troops without, and put them to flight; then
turning their own Cannon on the Plunderers, forced them to abandon the
City, leaving their Tents, Baggage, Provision, and Ammunition behind
them. In the Year 1521, it was taken by this _Solyman_, after a furious
Siege of two Months. It remain’d in the hands of the _Othomans_, till
the Year 1688, when the Imperialists took it by storm; fix hundred
Christian Slaves were chain’d together, and by the _Turks_ placed in
a rank before them, who by that means secured themselves, as well as
Christians from the furious Attacks of the _Germans_. It was retaken by
the _Turks_ two Years after, by an accidental _Bomb_ falling into their
_Magazine_ of Powder, that near half the Garrison were destroy’d, with
the Fortifications of the City. Pope _Leo_ X. made it a Bishoprick.

[F] _Rhodes_ (Rhodus) is an _Island_ in the _Mediterranean_ Sea, near
fifty Leagues in compass; the _Capital_ City, that _Solyman_ besieg’d,
takes its name from the _Island_. _Rhodes_ was once famous for a mighty
_Colossus_ dedicated to the Sun, of such a monstrous size that Vessels
_sail’d_ in _the Harbour_ between its Legs: it was seventy Cubits high.
The Brass of this Statue, (after it was thrown down by an Earthquake)
loaded seventy-two Camels, and was transported to _Alexandria_ in
_Egypt_, when it was taken by _Muhavia_ the Sultan. _Rhodes_ is
seated seven Leagues from the nearest Coast of _Asia_ to the South,
forty-seven from _Candi_ (another Island in the _Mediterranean_, made
famous by the Poets by the name of _Crete_) to the North-East, and a
hundred and sixty Leagues from _Constantinople_ to the South. It was
first peopled by _Javan_, the Grandson of _Japhet_, before any part
of _Greece_ was inhabited: in a few ages after, the _Phœnicians_
(famous for spreading Traffic over the World that was then known)
possess’d it. It was made a _Roman Province_ by _Vespasian_. In 654 it
was taken by the _Saracens_: in 1124 it was conquer’d by _Venetians_
it was taken in the Year 1227 by _John Ducas_, _Admiral_ of the
_Greeks_: in 1283, it fell with all lesser _Asia_ into the hands of
the _Othomans_: in 1310, it was taken (after a four Years Siege) by
the Knights of St. _John_ of _Jerusalem_, under _Fulk Villers_, an
_Englishman_, afterwards _Grand Master_ of the _Order_. It was vainly
attempted twice by _Mahomet_ II; till taken by Treachery by _Solyman_
the Magnificent. The _Knights_ of _Rhodes_ retir’d to _Sicily_; till
the Year 1530, _Charles_ V. gave them the Grant of the _Island_ of
_Malta_, where they have flourish’d ever since, often checking the
Insults of the _Turkish_ maritime Power.

[G] _Sophia_, the _Capital_ City of _Bulgaria_, a _Province_ of
_Hungary_, now in the hands of the _Othomans_. (The Turks are called
_Othomans_, from _Othoman_, the _first_ Founder of their _Empire_.)
’Tis seated on the River _Ciabrum_. It is famous for a General Council
that met in the Year 347, which condemn’d the Proceedings of the
Council of _Nice_, a City of _Bythinia_, that met in the year 325.
There it another City of that name in _Provence_.

[H] _Mohatz_, a strong Town in Lower _Hungary_ upon the _Danube_.

[I] _Buda_ is the Capital of the Kingdom of _Hungary_ formerly a rich
and strong City, before it fell into the hands of the _Othomans_, who
deftroy’d most of the stately Edifices: it lies on the west of the
River Danube over-against the Town of _Peste_ and join’d to it by a
Bridge of Boats, the Stream being too rapid, and wide to admit of any
other. In the year 1179 Pope _Nicholas_ III, and _Ladislaus_ King of
_Hungary_ held a _Council_ here. It is divided in two _Parts_, the
_Upper_ and the _Lower_; in the Lower Town there are now many _Baths_,
both _cold_ and _hot_, very finely adorn’d by the _Turks_ to perform
their _Abdest_ or _Washing_, before they enter their _Mosques_ or
Places of Devotion. It was taken by this _Solyman_ 1526, and retaken
by _Ferdinand_ Archduke Of _Austria_ 1527; _Solyman_ retook it again
1529, after the Garrison had bravely defended it in _eleven_ vigorous
Assaults. Ferdinand in 1541 attack’d it, when the Siege was raised by
our _Solyman_. It was twice besieg’d by the Christians without success
in 1598, and in 1601: in 1680 the Duke of _Lorrain_ besieg’d it without
success; but in 1686 took it by storm, after a noble Defence, tho’
an Army of fifty thousand _Turks_ look’d on. The Duke found there
the famous Library of the _Hungarian Kings_, inlarg’d by_ Matthias
Corvinus_, entire, which he transported to _Vienna_; four hundred
pieces of Cannon and Mortars, three hundred thousand gold Ducats,
besides many rich Vessels of Gold and Silver, magnificent Furniture,
and other valuable things.

[K] _Vienna_, the Capital of Germany, seated on the Danube, circled
by that River, as _Shrewsbury_ is by the _Severn_, it is one of
the largest Cities in _Germany_, as well as the strongest, and the
Residence of the Emperor.

[L] _Lintz_, a _Capital City_ of the Upper _Austria_, built upon
the _Danube_, with a handsome _Bridge_ over _that river_; ’tis a
well-fortified, strong, and populous place. The _Emperor_ has a
_castle_ for Pleasure, where he often retires from Business. It stands
about thirty Miles from _Vienna_.

[M] _Circumcision_ is not one of the _five Points_ which makes a
true _Mohametan_, but by Tradition brought from the _Arabians_. The
_Othomans_ never perform this Ceremony, till the male Child is upwards
of seven Years old. The Operator is a Surgeon. When the Child is
recover’d of his Wound, he is placed on horseback, and led through
the chief Streets of the Town, attended by the _Iman_ (or _Priest_)
with Children of its own Age. Till the Child is perfectly cured, the
Parents make a great Feast, inviting their Relations and Acquaintance
to partake of their Mirth. Grown People, or those that turn from the
Christian Religion (called Renegadoes) ride in triumph, with a Dart in
their left Hand, the Point directed to their left _Breast_, to signify
they would sooner have it thrust thro’ their Heart, than renounce that
Faiths being in the nature of Baptism with the Christians.

[N] _Circassia_ is a Province that extends from the _Bosphorus_ to the
_Eastern_ Shore of the _Euxine Sea_, famous for its beautiful Women;
and the _Seraglio_ is generally filled with them for the service of the
Emperor.

[O] The _Seraglio_ is the _Emperor’s Palace_, with large Gardens
bordering on the _Bosphorus_, the Sea that parts _Constantinople_ in
_Europe_, and _Scutari_ in _Asia_. There the Emperor’s Women are kept,
each in favour having their particular Apartments, being generally
attended by _black Eunuchs_, and those of the most deformed sort. The
young Slaves are also brought up here in a large Apartment, near the
Gate of the _Seraglio_ and though the Sons of Slaves often rise to the
highest Posts in the Empire; for in _Turkey_ Birth is seldom regarded,
but the greatest Merit rises to the highest Post, contrary to the Rules
of other Nations, where _Bribes_ and _Favour_ promote the Worthless. At
the age of twelve they are taken from the _Seraglio_, and employ’d in
Business according to their Capacity.

[P] _Guntz_, a small Town, situate upon a River of the same name in
_Lower Hungary_.

[Q] _Gratz_, the Capital City of _Stiria_; it stands upon the River
_Mure_, twenty Miles from _Vienna_ to the South.

[R] _Tunis_, the _Capital_ of a Country of the same name, is a large
City, five Miles in circumference. It a noble Port on the Coast of
_Barbary_, upon the _Mediterranean_, about eight Leagues from old
_Carthage_, the Birth-place of the famous _Hannibal_. This City has had
more Revolutions and Masters than any City in the Universe: but since
1570 it has remain’d in the possession of Kings of their own, till the
Line was extinct; and is now govern’d by a Bey as a Commonwealth, under
the Protection of the _Turk_.

[S] _Nice_, the Capital of _Bythinia_, (the old _Antigonia_.) This
City is remarkable for that famous _Council_ held against _Arianism_,
relating to the time of celebrating _Easter_ among the Christians,
with some Points of Church-Discipline, in the Imperial Palace of
_Constantine_ the _Great_, in the Year 325 of Christianity. There was
another design’d in the Year 359, but prevented by a sudden Earthquake,
which destroy’d a great part of the City. There was another Council
assembled in the Year 787, made up of three hundred and fifty Bishops.
_Nice_ was taken by _Godfrey_ of _Boloigne_ in his way to _Jerusalem_
in order to commence the Holy War, that cost so many thousand Lives,
and drain’d the Purses of almost all _Europe_.

[T] _Tauris_ (the old _Ecbatana_) the second City in the _Kingdom_ of
_Persia_, situated about thirty Miles from the _Caspian Sea_. In 849
it was deftroy’d by an Earthquake, very frequent in those mountainous
Countries. It underwent several Revolutions between the _Turks_ and
_Persians_, but now it remains in the hands of the famous _Kouli Kan_.

[U] _Babylon_ (or _Bagdat_ by the _Turks_ and _Persians_) is a City
celebrated in _sacred_ and _profane History_. It is built upon the
Banks of the famous River _Euphrates_, that had its spring from
_Paradise_ itself. It is said the Builder was _Nimrod_, the Grandchild
of _Noah_. The Walls were formerly forty-eight Miles in compass, and so
broad that two Chariots might pass each other. _Alexander_ in one of
his Victories made this Conquest, and in this City, Death put a slop to
all his Glories, and from seeking to be Master of the World, he only
found a Grave. _Grand Cairo_ in Egypt is founded on another _Babylon_;
from whence St. _Peter_ wrote his first _Epistle_. This City is built
upon the Banks of the famous River _Nile_, whose overflowings inriches
the Earth without Tillage.

[W] _Sultana Queen_. The _Turkish Emperors_ have avoided Marriage,
fearing any Change of Government might bring their _Queens_ to Infamy
and Disgrace; ever since _Tamerlane_ took _Bajazet_’s Wife _Arpasia_
Prisoner, and the more to insult _Bajazet_, forced _Arpasia_ to wait
naked at his Table.

[X] _Caramania_, a Province in _Lesser Asia_, over-against the _Island_
of _Cyprus_. It formerly had _Princes_ of its own, but it has been
many Ages subject to the _Turks_. It includes the ancient Provinces of
_Cilicia_, _Pamphylia_, and part of _Caria_.

[Y] _Aleppo_, a _City_ of _Syria_, built upon the River _Marsya_, which
falls into the _Euphrates_, is a very large Town, six miles in compass,
the greatest Place for Trade in all _Asia_. The _English_, _French_,
_Dutch_, and _Venetians_, have consuls always residing there.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
